  <p>Are tired of your old friends? Desparate to leave your fake, good for nothing Friends
     but don't know how? Here's how to make new friends:

     First, look around. Pay attention to everyone's apperance, actions, and vibes. A person's
     vibe is most important cause that determines how much you are willing to like that person.
     Once you found someone that catches you eye, say hello. Don't be shy! They are probnaly looking
     for a new friend. Just Like You! Say a joke or two and make sure you keep the conversation
     going. Usually describing a funny sitauation that happened to you usually works. If the
     converstaion is dry the nonexistent friendship is already a DUBBBB!!! RUN HOE!!!

     Hope these tips helped you.</p>

  <h3>Stay Fit</h3>
  <p>If you are reading this, you are well aware that you are out of shape. Get your lazy ass up
     and do excerises at least two times a day. One in the morning and one in the evening. Mountain
     climbers, planks, push-ups, reverse crunches, sit-ups are things your ass need to do in order
     to stay fit.</p>
